UseEffect:
=========

=> The UseEffect hook in React is used to perform the side effects such as fetching data,
   updating the DOM, and timers.

=> UseEffect accepts two arguments: a function(the effect) and an optional array of dependencies.

=> Without dependencies, the useEffect runs on every render.
   
    useEffect(() => {
        //Runs on every render
    });

=> To run it only once, pass an empty array of dependencies.
  
    useEffect(() => {
        //Runs only on the first render
    }, []);

=> If a variable is passed as a dependency, the effect will run again whenever that variable updates.

    useEffect(() => {
        //Runs on the first render
        //And any time any dependency value changes
    }, [variable]);
