Without using Async and Deffer:
------------------------------
HTML parsing is going on, once the script files encountered then script files are
fetched, then executed those script file and at the end rest of the html parsing
completed.


The flow is: 


parsing                   parsing again
       fetching executing


Async:
-----
HTML parsing is going on and the script files are fetched, once the html parsing before
scripts completed, then execution of script files starts, at final rest of the
html parsing is completed.

The flow is: 


parsing--          parsing again
fetching  executing



Deffer:
-----
HTML parsing is going on and the script files are fetched. Only after whole the
html parsing is completed script files are executed.


The flow is:
