CDN (Content Delivery Network):

-> Amazon, flipkart, netflix delivers data quickly, it is because they are using
CDNs.
-> Instead of making the call to origin server, user call is directed to CDN server,
internally CDN server calls the origin server. So the delivery of data is faster.

-> CDN distributes the Network traffic evenly among multiple servers. This load balancing
improves reliability and prevents the servers from becoming overwhelmed.

-> If one or more servers got failure, then the calls are redirected to other servers
to prevent uninteruption.

-> CDNs uses the Anycast routing, so that it transfers the traffic to another available server.
