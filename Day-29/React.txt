Why is React known as React?


React is called "React" because it's like a smart helper that knows how to change what you see on a computer screen whenever something new happens. 

Imagine you have a magic picture frame that can change the picture inside it whenever you get a new photo.

You don't have to take the old picture out and put a new one in yourself; the frame does it for you automatically.

In the same way, React helps computers show the right things on the screen by automatically updating the information when something changes. 

This is especially useful for things like games or websites where things need to change quickly, like when you get a new message or when your score updates in a game.

React is really good at "reacting" to these changes, which is why it's called React!
