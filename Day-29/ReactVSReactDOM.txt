React
=====
Purpose: 
=======
React is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications. 
It focuses on the "view" layer of an application, allowing developers to create reusable UI components that efficiently update and render as data changes.

Functionality: 
==============
React provides the core functionality for defining components, managing state and props, and handling lifecycle methods.
It uses a virtual DOM to optimize rendering performance.


ReactDOM
=========
Purpose: 
========
ReactDOM is a library that provides DOM-specific methods that allow React to interact with the browser's Document Object Model (DOM).

Functionality: 
==============
It is responsible for rendering React components to the DOM. 
ReactDOM includes methods like ReactDOM.render() to mount React components to a specified DOM node, and ReactDOM.hydrate() for server-side rendering.


React is the core library for building UI components, while ReactDOM is responsible for rendering those components to the web page.
React can be used independently of the DOM, such as in React Native for mobile apps, whereas ReactDOM is specifically for web applications.
