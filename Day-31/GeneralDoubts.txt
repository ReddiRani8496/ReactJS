bundlers -> webpack, parcel, vite

npm install -D parcel -> Developer mode for that we mentioned -D

-> when we run parcel command, node modules and packagelock.json created, and in package.json the dependencies key pointing to parcel added


Diff b.w ~ and caret(^) in package.json

~ if new major version came, the project will automatically update
^ if new minor version came, the project will automatically update
if don't use any of these signs -> even new version comes, project won't update

packagelock.json -> locks the version,
never keep in gitignore (bcz some times it won't work in productions, it will work in our system)

integrity:sha (to make sure the version in my system and server same or not)


node modules -> we don't upload to git, becuase it is heavy
we will send the packagelock.json, so that we can download node modules in server


don't use cdn links, why? because whenever react version changes, we need to change the links
and also to fetch the dependencies from our server faster than cdn links server


npm install react -> to install react instead of cdn links
npm install react-dom or npm i react-dom

npx parcel index.html -> here index.html (start of our project) -> npx means execute using npm
the above command will give server url where our project using

in script.js
import the react because now we don't have cdn links, now we have to use from node module so we need to import
import reactDOM from "react-dom/client" also

if we import react and react dom in js file, we will get error, because it will consider it has a normal js file,
we have to mention it is a module
so in index.html, in script tag write -> <script type="module" src="script.js">

why dist folder created?
To hold all the production files created by parcel
npx parcel build index.html

the code which we write in App.js will be seen in dist folder -> index.js file
but it wil appear in the last, there are many lines of js code that is for imports of react and react-dom


port number will be there is parcel-cache folder, even if we run two projects same time parcel will provide two different port numbers


should we push parcel-cache in gitignore?
we should put parcel-cache in gitignore

why we should put?
because which is auto generated will be put inside gitignore
