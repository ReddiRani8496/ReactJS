HMR -> Hot Module Reload 
it means parcle making track of all our changes, when we change something it will reflects on browser
File Watcher Algorithm -> parcel uses it to reload the changes
minifying
bundling
cleaning our code (removes console.logs in production file)
super fast build algorithm
image optimization
caching while development(at start of building parcel it will take more time, same thing if we repeat it will take less time because it using caching)
compressiong (renames variables during production)
compatible with older version of browser
port number
consistent hashing algorithm
zero config file
