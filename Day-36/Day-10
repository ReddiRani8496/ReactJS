we do not mutate state directly

class based component lifecycle:
==============================
constructor
component render
component didmount (same like useeffect in functional component)


Q) parent-constructor
   parent-didmount
   parent-render
   
   child-constructor
   child-didmount
   child-render

what is the order of execution

Ans: parent-constructor
   parent-render
   child-constructor
   child-render
   child-didmount
   parent-didmount
   
   
React life cycle

1. Render phase
2. commit phase

if we have two children
 parent-constructor
 parent-render
   first child-constructor
   first child-render
   second child-constructor
   second child-render
   
   // commit phase -> DOM updated for children
   
   first child - didmount
   second child - didmount
   
 parent-didmount
 
 
 
 
 most important interview question:
 we can't make useeffect async
 we can make component did mount async while making api call
 
 
 
Component Did mount: after the first render
component update: after every re-render

The same thing in functional component is
useEffect -> after first render
dependency array -> to re-render
