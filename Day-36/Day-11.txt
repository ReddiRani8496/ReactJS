Chunking
--------
Chunking refers to the process of breaking down a large bundle of code into smaller, manageable pieces called "chunks."
 In the context of Webpack, a popular module bundler, chunks are distinct components that form a bundle.
 Each chunk is loaded independently, which can improve load times by only loading necessary code when needed.


Code Splitting
--------------
Code splitting is a technique used to split code into separate bundles that can be loaded on demand. 
This helps in reducing the initial load time of an application by loading only the required code for the current view or route. 
In React, this can be achieved using React.lazy and React.Suspense:

Dynamic Bundling
-----------------
Dynamic bundling involves creating bundles that can be changed or updated without requiring a full app update. 
This is particularly useful in mobile apps using React Native, 
where libraries like react-native-dynamic-bundle allow for dynamic updates and A/B testing without going through app store updates.

Lazy Loading
-------------
Lazy loading is a design pattern that delays the loading of non-essential resources until they are needed. 
In React, lazy loading is implemented using React.lazy to load components asynchronously

On-Demand Loading
------------------
On-demand loading is similar to lazy loading but emphasizes loading resources exactly when they are needed based on user interaction or specific conditions. 
This ensures that only the necessary code is executed at any given time.

Dynamic Import
--------------
Dynamic import allows importing modules dynamically at runtime rather than at compile time. 
This enables asynchronous loading of modules, which can be beneficial for performance optimization
