What is Babel?

Babel is a JavaScript compiler that allows developers to write code using the latest JavaScript features and then transpile that code into a version that is compatible with older browsers.
This ensures that modern JavaScript code can run in environments that do not yet support the latest language features.

Why it is useful?

While building React with JSX syntax. 
Becuase JSX is not valid JavaScript and needs to be transformed into standard JavaScript that browsers can understand.
Babel is used to perform this transformation.

-> Even when our system does not support node.js, we are not able to create react-app. 
-> In such scenarios we can user Babel module to create react-app

Steps to create react-app using Babel module:
=============================================

Step1: import 3 modules i.e. react , react-dom, Babel

<script src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js" crossorigin></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js" crossorigin></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@babel/standalone/babel.min.js"></script>

step2: Create a div element inside the body and give an id, it act as an react root container

step3: add script tag before closing the body tag, the type of tag is "text/babel"

step4: inside the script tag create the react component.

step5: select the react root container and add to react-dom 

stpe6: render the react component
