1. What problem does React solve in web development?
Ans: React solves key web development challenges by:
Efficient UI Updates: Uses a Virtual DOM to optimize rendering and improve performance.
Component-Based Architecture: Enables reusable, modular, and maintainable code.
State Management: Simplifies handling dynamic data and application state.
Declarative Syntax: Makes UI development predictable and easier to debug.
Scalability: Handles complex applications with a unidirectional data flow.
Cross-Platform Development: Supports web and mobile via React Native.
SEO Optimization: Enables server-side rendering for better search engine indexing.

2. Is react javasript library or framework?
Ans: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It focuses on rendering UI components and managing state, making it lightweight and flexible. 
Unlike frameworks, React doesn’t dictate the app’s structure or include features like routing or state management, which need to be added separately.
