What are Pure Components in React
ReactJS has provided us with a Pure Component. If we extend a class with Pure Component, there is no need for the shouldComponentUpdate() lifecycle method. 
ReactJS Pure Component Class compares the current state and props with new props and states to decide whether the React component should re-render itself or not.

In simple words, If the previous value of the state or props and the new value of the state or props are the same, the component will not re-render itself. 
Pure Components restricts the re-rendering when there is no use for re-rendering of the component. Pure Components are Class Components that extend React.PureComponent.
