why to use default in export?
to export only one component
while importing don't use curly braces, we can directly import
when we use default no need to have same name, it can be anything

export default function mainFunction() {
  console.log('This is the default export');
}

import mainFunc from './module.js';

named export?
while importing use curly braces

export const name = 'John';
export function greet() {
  console.log('Hello');
}

import { name, greet } from './module.js';


* as Export
===========
Purpose: Re-exports all exports from another module under a single namespace.
Syntax: Use the export * as syntax.

why state?
==========
state is an object that holds information about a component that may change over time. It allows components to be dynamic and interactive by updating the component's rendered output in response to user actions or system events

why useState?
to create variables, it comes from react library.
The useState hook in React is a function that allows you to add state management to functional components. It takes an initial state value as an argument and returns an array containing the current state and a function to update that state. This hook simplifies state management by enabling functional components to maintain and update local state without needing class components

what is hook?
Hook is nothing but a normal function, but it has specific function for it.
React Hooks have transformed the way developers write React applications by allowing functional components to be more powerful and easier to manage, leading to cleaner and more maintainable codebases
