What is webcrawler?

While making search engine , webcrawler is used.
It will search the links in the home page and holds all the links and searches recursively,
it avoids repetation of searching the results in same link, so it uses recursively search.

Example:
index.html is out home page 
  inside this we have a,b,c,d files links
  inside a -> e, f files are there

  so first it searches in a, then inside a, e and f files will be searched.
